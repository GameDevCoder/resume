    details: >-
      <p>I attended the game development school <b>Digipen</b> in <u>Vancouver, British Columbia</u>.</p>
      <p>While there, I routinely studied technology, complex algorithms, mathematics and programming.</p>
      <p>Together with a small group of students, I learned to work as a team to create a game project.</p>
      <p>As the school was shifting towards migrating to the United States, I decided to<br/>continue my studies independently.</p>
