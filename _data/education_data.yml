    details: >-
      <p>I attended Digipen in Vancouver, British Columbia for the foundation year.</p>
      
      <p>I routinely studied technology, complex algorithms and mathematics,
      learning how to apply my studies to theoretical situations and programming applications.</p>
      
      <p>The first platform I learned to program for was the Mac.<br/>
      I learned how to programmatically open and display image files,<br/>
      render animated, buffered 2d sprite graphics and play back audio.</p>
      
      <p>Near the year end, I worked with a small team of students to create a game project</p>
      
      <p>I found the course to be both fun and challenging.</p>
      
      <p>As the school was migrating to the United States, I decided to continue my studies 
      on my own before pursuing a career in the games industry overseas.</p>
