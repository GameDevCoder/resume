  - degree: The Art and Science of <br/> 2D & 3D <br/> Video Game Programming <br/> (Foundation Year)
    university: 'Digipen'

    time: 1997 ~ 1998
    details: >-
      <p>I attended Digipen in Vancouver, British Columbia for the foundation year.</p>
      
      <p>I routinely studied technology, complex algorithms and mathematics,
      learning how to apply my studies to theoretical situations and programming applications.</p>
      
      <p>Example:<br/>
      Mario and Luigi are sitting inside cannons on oppposite sides of the screen.<br/>
      The cannons have slightly different angles.<br/>
      What power levels do the cannons need to be and when does each cannon<br/>
      need to be fired in order to get Mario and Luigi to meet mid-air?</p>
      
      <p>I found the course to be both fun and challenging.</p>
      
      <p>As the school was migrating to the United States, I decided to continue my studies 
      on my own before pursuing a career in the games industry overseas.</p>
