     <p>From the fall of 2017 up to present, I am working as a Technical Artist at Cygames in Shibuya, Tokyo.</p>
     <p>Recently, I have been working on Project Awakening, programming Art Pipeline tools such as:</p>
     <div markdown="1">
     <b>Studio Library</b> - A free tool for creating character poses in Autodesk Maya
       - Added <b>Perforce integration</b> to allow the artists to update, checkout and submit their poses to the Perforce repo directly from Maya.
       - Added <b>relative position and relative rotation</b> support, making it possible to apply StudioLibrary poses to characters at Maya world locations other than the origin.
       - Created a <b>renaming tool</b> to rename the Studio Library asset folders in order to conform to development naming conventions.
     </div>
